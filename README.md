# Getting and cleaning data: Course Project

### Overview

Course project for the Johns Hopkins Getting and Cleaning Data course (https://www.coursera.org).

This repository contains the files related to the course project which deals with collecting, working with, and cleaning a data set.

### Detailed description
The repository contains the following files:
- codeBook.md: the code book containing the description of the original dataset, of the processing performed on this dataset and of the final tidy dataset.
- run_analysis.R: R code performing the processing steps described in the code book and generating a file named 'tidy_data.txt' containing the final tidy dataset.

### Note
To run the R code successfully, the original data (described in the code book) should be contained in a folder named 'UCI HAR Dataset' located in the same directory as the file run_analysis.R.
