# Getting and cleaning data: Course Project

### Overview

Course project for the Johns Hopkins Getting and Cleaning Data course (https://www.coursera.org).

This repository contains the files related to the course project which deals with collecting, working with, and cleaning a data set.

### Detailed description
The repository contains the following files:
- codeBook.md: the code book containing the description of the original dataset, of the processing performed on this dataset and of the final tidy dataset.
- run_analysis.R: R code performing the processing steps described in the code book and generating a file named 'tidy_data.txt' containing the final tidy dataset.

### Note
To run the R code successfully, the user should specify in the line 2 of the file 'run_analysis.R' the path to the folder where the original data is stored. The 'tidy_data.txt' will be saved in the same folder.
